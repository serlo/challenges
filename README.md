# Coding challenges and mockups

This repository contains [tasks](https://github.com/serlo/challenges/issues) for coding challenges in interviews. They are directly from our roadmap and reflect work to do or problems to solve in the future. Thus they give an impression on the work we do at Serlo. You can get a good idea about our work by looking into our other repositories. In case you want to contribute, please have a look at [our "Getting started" section](https://github.com/serlo#getting-started) on GitHub.
